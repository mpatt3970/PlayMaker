TESTING STRATEGIES

Our program simulates football plays, and thus we have selected the following
higher level aspects to test:

-Player movement
	
	We are testing that players move correctly and that the ball moves but does not
	change its target location.

-Full Teams

	We are testing that the offensive and defensive teams are setup with 11 players
	each so that there are no unexpected null pointer exceptions later

-Loading Plays
	
	The next test loads a known play text file for the offense and defense, and
	ensures that each player’s location and routes were initialized correctly

-Loading Defense

	This test makes sure the defense is only initialized with blockers and defenders
	and that no defensive players start with the ball

-Collision Detection

	This test makes sure that when two players are next to eachother, the correct
	collison consequences occur.  This means sometimes a player does not move.

-Blocking

	We tested that the collision blocking function sometimes stops the player, and
	sometimes lets the player through

-Processing plays

	This test ensures everyone is initialized and moves during a play, that the ball 
	is in someone’s possesion, and that the play ends.
